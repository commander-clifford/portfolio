							<p>
								I've been working with digital media for over <span class="bold">10 years</span>, and I love learning new things everyday.
								My enthusiasm for technology is the human factor, the interface and the users experience are the keystones to any well executed solution.
								With a background in design and engineering, I think with an artistic and scientific mindset - bringing a unique perspective to the table.
							</p>
							<p>
								To start my career, I did a tour in the <span class="bold">Navy</span> where I studied electronics engineering.
								Later, I received an honorable discharge from the Navy and I joined a <span class="bold">Department of Defense Contractor</span>.
								Where I worked on the Navy's shipboard CCTV systems as the lead engineer for the prototyping and build of the next generation broadcast studio system for larger Navy vessels.
							</p>
							<p>
								I've studied <span class="bold">engineering, psychology and design</span>, in 2014 I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Web Design and had a 4.0 GPA.
								Today, my favorite exercise is collaborating with team members to design and build game changing experiences from the ground up. <a href="index.php?page=about"> ...see more.</a>
