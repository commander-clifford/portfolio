						<p>
							I've been working with digital media for over <span class="bold">10 years</span>, and I love learning new things everyday.
							My enthusiasm for technology is the human factor, the interface and the users experience are the keystones to any well executed solution.
							With a background in design and engineering, I think with an artistic and scientific mindset - bringing a unique perspective to the table.
						</p>
						<p>
							After high-school I did a tour in the <span class="bold">Navy</span> where I studied <span class="bold">electronics engineering</span>.
							While gaining experience working with complex electronic and electromechanical systems, I also gained a lot of other key values.
						</p>
						<p>
							A few years later, I received an honorable discharge from the Navy and I joined a <span class="bold">Department of Defense Contractor</span> where I was able to use my talents to improve the Navy's shipboard entertainment systems.
							During my tenure with the Defense Media Activity I was the lead engineer for the prototyping and build of the next generation broadcast studio system for larger Navy vessels.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since then I've studied <span class="bold">psychology, design and engineering</span> where I've really honed in on user advocacy.
							Today, my favorite exercise is collaborating with team members to build game changing experiences from the ground up.
