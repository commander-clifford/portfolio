				<p class="paragraph-typ-1">
					I've been working with digital media for over <span class="bold">10 years</span>, and I love learning new things everyday. My enthusiasm for technology is the human factor, the user interface is the keystone to any good solution. With a background in design and engineering, I think with an artistic and scientific mindset <br> - bringing a unique perspective to the table. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph-typ-1">
					It started after high-school with a tour in the <span class="bold">Navy</span> where I studied <span class="bold">electronics engineering</span>. While gaining experience working with complex electronic and electromechanical systems. I also learned a lot of other key values during this period. 
        		</p>
        		<p class="paragraph-typ-1">
          			After an honorable discharge from the Navy I joined a <span class="bold">Department of Defense Contractor</span> where I was able to use my talents to improve the Navy's shipboard entertainment systems. During my tenure with the Defense Media Activity I was the lead engineer in prototyping a next generation broadcast studio system for larger Navy ships. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph-typ-1">
					Since then I've studied <span class="bold">psychology, design and engineering</span> where I really honed in on user advocacy. Today, my favorite exercise is collaborating with team members to build game changing experiences from the ground up.
