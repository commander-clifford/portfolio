			While working with IBM on two Military logistics projects I had influence on several aspects of design and development. In this project I took a page that had one row of visually identical buttons and made it more intuitive. The first and most obvious modification was to break the utility functions out into their own utility navigation bar to symbolize their difference from the application navigation options.
