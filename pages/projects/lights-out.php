		This is my first and still my favorite experiment with Java-script and CSS3 rendering.  The project was to make a game, I choose to recreate a classic electronic game. I even kept the Power button for nostalgia sake. All art work in this project is done with CSS, no image pixels to be found.

		This code was originated in ~2013. With that being said some of the jQuery functions that were used have been deprecated. I used the .bind method to bind click events to each of the buttons: which I believe is the source of the issue. It does tend to work in the safari browser currently - in the future I'd like to update this legacy code. For now open this link in Safari to get the true experience.
